Agentic AI Learning Repository 🎉

Overview 🚀

This repository contains study materials and code examples for mastering the fundamentals of Agentic AI, including Prompt Engineering, Markdown formatting, Pydantic data validation, and the OpenAI Agents SDK. It serves as a comprehensive resource for learners and developers working on agent-based AI systems. 🌟

Topics Covered 📚

Prompt Engineering 💡

Temperature, top_k, and top_p effects: Understanding how these parameters influence model output. 📊
Safe system messages for sensitive data: Techniques to ensure data privacy in prompts. 🔒
Chain of Thought prompting: Guiding models to reason step-by-step. 🤔
Tree of Thoughts prompting: Enabling complex, multi-path reasoning. 🌳


Markdown 😄

Clickable images with tooltips: Enhancing documentation with interactive elements. 📷
Numbered and bulleted list formatting: Organizing content effectively. 📝


Pydantic 🛠️

@pydantic.dataclasses.dataclass vs BaseModel: Comparing data structure options. 🔍
Type hints for validation and schema definition: Ensuring robust data validation. ✅
Using dataclasses as output_type in agents: Integrating with agent outputs. 📤


OpenAI Agents SDK 🤖

🚀General concepts & defaults: Core principles of agent functionality. 🌐
🚀Handoffs (concept, usage, parameters, callbacks): Transferring tasks between agents. 🔄
🚀Tool calls & error handling during execution: Managing tool interactions and errors. 🛠️
🚀Dynamic instructions: Adapting agent behavior contextually. 🎛️
🚀Agent configuration: Setting up agents with instructions and tools. ⚙️
🚀Guardrails (purpose, timing, tripwires): Ensuring safe and controlled execution. 🛡️
🚀Tracing (traces vs spans, multi-run traces): Monitoring agent execution paths. 📈
🚀Hooks (RunHooks, AgentHooks): Customizing agent lifecycle events. 🪝
🚀Model settings: Configuring model behavior and constraints. 🎚️
🚀Runner method (run, run_sync, run_streamed) and use cases: Executing agent workflows. 🏃‍♂️
🚀Tool calling: Integrating external functions with agents. 🛠️
🚀output_type behavior and schema strictness: Defining and validating output structures. 📋
